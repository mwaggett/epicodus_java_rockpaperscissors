# Rock, Paper, Scissors

##### _Integration Testing practice for Epicodus, 12 August 2015_

#### By **Daryl Seaver & Molly Waggett**

## Description

This app allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer or a friend. When playing against a computer, the player types their choice and the computer chooses at random. When playing against a friend, both players type their choices _**(players can see each other's choices at this point, which is obviously not ideal)**_. Then, results are displayed. If the player(s) type(s) something other than rock, paper, or scissor, no one wins.
